Repo for Conversation AI Module 

## Initial roles (Improved - but can still be refined):
|Name|Role|Responsibilities|Implementation Tasks|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Jack**|Project Coordinator & System Integrator|	- Oversees project progress, manages documentation, and ensures deadlines are met. - Compiles all sections into a coherent research plan and final presentation. - Ensures all components work together as a functional system.|- Implements system integration & pipeline management, ensuring individual models (NLU, retrieval, ranking, evaluation) communicate properly. - Tests end-to-end system functionality and resolves integration issues.|
|**Ruben**|NLU & Query Understanding Specialist|- Researches how to determine when a query needs clarification (ambiguity detection). - Investigates Rasa/BERT models for detecting unclear queries. - Determines when to trigger a clarifying question.|- Implements an intent classifier (BERT/Rasa) to detect ambiguous queries. - Trains and tests a model to classify queries as clear or ambiguous. - Provides query classification outputs to the Clarifying Question Specialist.|
|**Ansh**|Clarifying Question Retrieval/Generation Specialist|- Researches methods for retrieving or generating relevant clarifying questions. - Investigates neural ranking, question retrieval, and NLG models.|- Implements a retrieval-based (BERT/Splade) or generation-based (GPT/BART/T5) model to produce clarifying questions. - Retrieves questions from a predefined dataset or generates new ones based on query context. - Outputs candidate clarifying questions to the Ranking Specialist.|
|**Andy**|Ranking & Selection Specialist|	- Works on how to ranking clarifying questions to ensure the most relevant one is chosen. - Investigates neural ranking models (Splade/BERT-based ranking).|- Implements a ranking model (Splade/BERT-based ranking) to score and rank clarifying questions. - Ensures that the top-ranked question is chosen for the user. - Outputs the best-ranked clarifying question to the System Integrator for final processing.|
|**Jordan**|Evaluation, Metrics & Data Specialist|	- Researches system effectiveness and validation methods. - Looks into standard evaluation metrics from Information Retrieval (Precision, MRR, Recall, etc.). - Designs testing methodology. – Collects and prepares the question dataset for retrieval/generation.|- Implements evaluation metrics (Precision, MRR, Recall). - Develops a synthetic evaluation dataset for testing performance. - Runs automated retrieval and ranking evaluations. – Preparation of question dataset for model training/testing.- Builds a simple API, script, or framework to connect components. |
