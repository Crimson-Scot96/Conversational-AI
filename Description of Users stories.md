User Stories vs. Use Cases:
User Story: A user story is a short, simple description of a feature or function from the perspective of the end user or customer. It focuses on what the user needs and why it's valuable to them. Typically, user stories are used in Agile methodologies and are written in a simple format:

Format:
As a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [I can achieve a benefit].

Example of a User Story:
As an online shopper, I want to be able to filter products by price range so that I can find items that fit my budget.

Use Case: A use case is a detailed description of how a system will interact with the user or another system to accomplish a specific task. It outlines all the steps and actions involved, typically from the perspective of the system's functionality. Use cases are more detailed and include specific scenarios, actors, preconditions, and exceptions.

Format:
A use case typically includes:

Actors (who is involved)
Preconditions (what must be true before the use case starts)
Main Flow (the primary sequence of actions)
Alternate Flows (alternative paths if something goes wrong)
Postconditions (what happens after the case is complete)
Example of a Use Case:
Title: Add Item to Shopping Cart

Actor: Online Shopper
Preconditions: Shopper is logged in and browsing a product catalog.
Main Flow:
Shopper selects an item from the product catalog.
Shopper clicks the "Add to Cart" button.
The item is added to the shopping cart.
Shopper is shown a confirmation message.
The updated cart is visible with the added item.
Alternate Flow:
If the item is out of stock, the shopper is shown a message saying "Out of Stock."
If the shopper tries to add more than the available quantity, they are prompted with a "Quantity exceeds available stock" message.
Postconditions: The shopping cart is updated with the new item.
