   note = {Proposes a <b>zero-shot method</b> to generate clarifying questions <b>without requiring conversational search logs</b> or labeled training data.<br/><br/>The method extracts <b>query facets</b> (e.g., "pictures", "maps", "population" for "South Africa") and <b>guides the question generation process</b> so that the generated clarifying question is <b>contextually relevant</b>.<br/><br/>We could use <b>a predefined set of facets</b> or <b>identify key terms in the query</b> to generate clarifying questions.<br/><br/>Unlike other papers that <b>evaluate question quality based on search performance</b>, this paper <b>evaluates question usefulness independently</b>. Uses <b>automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) and human judgments</b> to assess how <b>natural and useful</b> the generated questions are.},
